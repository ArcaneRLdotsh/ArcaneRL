# Prompts to generate internal and external thoughts based on top relevant memories
default_query: |-
  Hey ChatGPT, I need your help choosing what to eat for my next meal. 
  There are three factors I want to consider: '{health}', '{time}', and '{cost}'. I want to optimize '{time}' to prepare and eat my meal in '{time_value}' points on a scale of 1 to 100 points . 
  For '{health}', I want the  meal to be '{health_value}' points on a scale of 1 to 100 points. 
  Finally, for '{cost}', I want meal to be '{cost_value}' points on a scale of 1 to 100 points.
  When you are inquisitive mode, I want you to suggest me something based on these three factors. 
  However, I want you to make six assumptions that would allow you to come up with one suggestion for me. 
  These assumptions should take into account my preferences for time, price, and health, as well as other factors you think are relevant. 
  They should be very short, be very specific. Instructions and ingredients should not be shortened. I have cooking skills and access to basic cooking equipment, it should not be an assumption. 
  If flavors and cuisines are mentioned, one cuisine should be chosen based on ChatGPT preferences without stating it's ChatGPT favourite. 
  Answer with a JSON array that follows the following structure 
  {
    "Result type": "Recipe",
    "Assumptions": ["Vegetarian", "Gluten-free", "Low-carb"],
    "Body": {
      "title": "Name of the result",
      "rating": 4.8,
      "image_link": "image link of the product",
      "prep_time": "prep time in minutes" ,
      "cook_time": "cook time in minutes" ",
      "description": "Product description",
      "ingredients": [
        "1 large head cauliflower, chopped",
        "2 eggs"
      ],
      "instructions": [
        "Preheat oven to 425Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
        "In a food processor, pulse cauliflower until it forms rice-like pieces. Microwave for 8 minutes, or until soft. Let cool for a few minutes and transfer to a clean kitchen towel. Squeeze as much water as you can out of the cauliflower.",
        "In a large bowl, mix together the cauliflower, eggs, 2 cups of shredded mozzarella, Parmesan cheese, almond flour, garlic powder, salt, and pepper until well combined."
      ]
    }
  }
  If the suggestion type is something else, it should follow the same format specified above with the clearly differentiated "Result type" field
