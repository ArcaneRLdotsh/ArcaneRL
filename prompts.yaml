# Prompts to generate internal and external thoughts based on top relevant memories
default_query: |-
  Hey ChatGPT, I need your help choosing what to eat for my next meal. 
  There are three factors I want to consider: "{factor_1}", "{factor_2}", and "{factor_3}". For time, I have "{factor_1}" to prepare and eat my meal. 
  For "{factor_2}", I want "{factor_2_option}". 
  Finally, for "{factor_3}", I want "{factor_3_option}".
  When you are inquisitive mode, I want you to suggest me something based on these three factors. 
  However, I want you to make six assumptions that would allow you to come up with one suggestion for me. 
  These assumptions should take into account my preferences for time, price, and health, as well as other factors you think are relevant. 
  They should be very short, be very specific. I have cooking skills and access to basic cooking equipment, it should not be an assumption. 
  If flavors and cuisines are mentioned, one cuisine should be chosen based on ChatGPT preferences without stating it's ChatGPT favourite. 
  If there is an assumption about ingredients, they should be listed very specifically. 
  Assumptions should start with "Assumptions:" and be shown as a list, the result should start with "Result:" and be shown as a list.  
  List another 6 assumptions user might want to include with "Potential Assumptions:" 
  Summarize with one word at the top starting with "Result type" what kind of result you are offering
