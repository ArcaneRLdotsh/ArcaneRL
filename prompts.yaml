# Prompts to generate internal and external thoughts based on top relevant memories
default_query: |-
 I need your help choosing what to eat for my next meal. 
  There are three factors I want you to consider: '{factor1}' '{factor2}' '{factor3}'
  When you are inquisitive mode, I want you to suggest me something based on these three factors. 
  However, I want you to make six assumptions that would allow you to come up with one suggestion for me. 
  These assumptions should take into account my preferences for the factors above as well as other factors you think are relevant. 
  They should be very short, be very specific. Instructions and ingredients should not be shortened. 
  Answer with multiple recipes in a JSON that follows the following structure

internal_thought: |-
  You have been given the following input: {query}. 
  You must think about it and plan what action to take.
  For some context, here are your memories related to the query.
   
  MEMORIES sorted in relevance:
  {top_matches}

  Think of some actions you would take after hearing "{query}" based on your past thoughts and actions.
  This is not shown to the outside world but only to yourself. It is just your internal thought. Make this thought very short "

external_thought: |-
  MEMORIES sorted in relevance:
  {top_matches}

  Based on the query, you have thought about the input and had the following thought: 
  
  {internal_thought}. 
  Based on your thought and memories, respond to the query. You don't have to refer to them if they aren't useful.
